        <h3 className='shead'>Pregnant women are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people?</h3>
      <p>
      Pregnant women or recently pregnant women who are  older, overweight, and have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes seem to have an increased  risk of developing severe COVID-19. When pregnant women develop severe disease, they also seem to more often require care in intensive care units than non-pregnant women of reproductive age.

      Pregnancy can alter how your body handles severe viral infections in some women. Due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) to their healthcare provider. </p>
         
      <h3 className='shead'>Basic Protection Steps</h3>

    Pregnant women should take the same precautions to avoid COVID-19 infection as other people. You can help protect yourself by:
        <ol>
            <li>
            Washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
            </li>
            <li>
            Keeping space between yourself and others and avoiding crowded spaces. Wear a non-medical, fabric  mask where it is not possible to keep sufficient physical distance between yourself and others.Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
            </li>
            <li>
            Practicing respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
            If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult the directions of your local health authority. However in emergy situations, pregnant women and women who have recently delivered must visit hospitals and take adaptive measures to reduce possible transmission of the virus. 
    </p>
         
         <p>
         As a precaution, you should follow government advice about social distancing, stay away from public places and avoid anyone who has possible coronavirus symptoms. It is still considered not completely safe for pregnant women to go out for essentials, such as food shopping, exercise and to attend antenatal appointments. If you are in your third trimester (more than 28 weeks’ pregnant) you should be particularly attentive to social distancing and minimise any contact with others.

        Stay as far away from other members of your household as possible, especially if they are clinically extremely vulnerable. Avoid using shared spaces such as kitchens and other living areas while others are present and take your meals back to your room to eat.

      <h3 className='shead'>How can I protect my mental wellbeing during the pandemic?</h3>
      In times like these, it can be difficult to keep anxiety under control. But try to remember that anxiety is a normal response to a threatening situation, so it is understandable that so many people are feeling like this right now. However, there are things that can help you to feel more in control. Here are few ways to manage anxiety in pregnancy during the pandemic.
      <ol>
          <li>
          <b>Avoid the constant news updates -</b> Of course it’s important to keep up to date with the official guidelines for pregnant women during this pandemic. But constantly checking the latest updates will only feed your anxiety. Try to concentrate on what you need to know and ignore everything else. Only read trusted sources of information and avoid social media. You could try reading about what’s happening in the morning and then focus on other things for the rest of the day. Try to avoid any news exposure for at least an hour before going to bed. If you want to avoid the news completely but are worried about missing any key updates, you could try asking your partner, friend, or family member to update you with relevant news. 
          </li>
          <li>
          <b>Call a friend or family member -</b> Getting things off your chest and talking your worries through with an understanding and trustworthy friend, family member or work colleague can make all the difference. Talk to someone you love about how you’re feeling. Remember that you are not alone.
          </li>
          <li>
          <b>Distract yourself -</b> If you find that your thoughts are spiralling out of control, it may help to try and distract yourself. Anxiety can make it very difficult to concentrate, so try to keep it simple. Read a magazine in the garden, do a jigsaw or crossword, knit, do some colouring in, have a bath or watch your favourite comedy. Simple pleasures count.
          </li>
          <li>
          <b>Bring yourself back to this moment -</b> Thinking about what might happen or the ‘what ifs?’ is a very normal response in these uncertain times. Humans like to feel in control of things, so looking for answers and trying to predict what will happen is just our brain’s way of trying to help us feel safe. But focussing excessively on these thoughts can become unhelpful because you will find yourself asking a lot of questions that you don’t have the answers for. Only now matters because this is what you can control. Focus on how you feel now and what you’re doing now.
